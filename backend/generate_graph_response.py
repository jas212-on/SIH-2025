Notes:
- "India" is the only Country.
- States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat are (:State), not (:Country).
- Places like ernakulam, kottayam, thrissur, etc are districts of kerala.
- Convert states and districts to capital letters
- If asked for recharge_worthy or non_recharge_worthy_area, mention it in the type property of (:Area)
- If asked for total area, remember the type is "total"
- If have to use BlockSummary node, simply return the value of what is asked
